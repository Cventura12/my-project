# System Voice — Phase 3 Step 3

Goal: Create a strict, neutral, factual language system that conveys authority
without motivation, shame, or friendliness.

Default bias: Cold > comforting.

## Language Rules
- Declarative only. No questions.
- Falsifiable only. Every sentence must be verifiable.
- State facts only. No advice, encouragement, or emotional framing.
- No hedging or softeners.

## Sentence Structures (Allowed)
- "[State] [verb]."
  - Example: "Verification pending."
- "[Subject] [verb] [object]."
  - Example: "Proof not received."
- "[Condition] [verb] [state]."
  - Example: "Dependency unmet. Obligation blocked."
- "[Record] [verb] [timestamp]."
  - Example: "Risk accepted by user on 2026-02-05."

## Allowed Verbs (Exact Set)
- Required
- Pending
- Blocked
- Submitted
- Verified
- Failed

No other verbs are permitted in system statements.

## Forbidden Language (Explicit)
The following phrases are banned:
- "You should"
- "We recommend"
- "Don't forget"
- "Great job"
- "Oops"
- Any motivational tone or encouragement

## Override Language (Required)
Overrides must be framed exactly as:
"Risk accepted by user on [date]."

No reassurance. No mitigation. No advice.

## Output Summary
Neutral authority builds trust because it limits the system to facts that can be
verified. This tone avoids false confidence by removing persuasion, motivation,
and subjective framing.
